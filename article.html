            Global report: WHO warns of accelerating Covid-19 infections in
            Africa
          </h2>

          <h4 class="fw-bold heading-4">
            Continent is seeing more cases spread to the provinces; Trump
            supporters can’t sue over catching Covid-19 at rallies; Brazil
            confirms 30,000 new cases
          </h4>

          <hr />
          <p>
            South Africa is the worst-affected country on the continent, with
            more than a quarter of all infections. But most countries have fewer
            than 1,000 infections, said Moeti, and the UN does not believe that
            severe cases are going undetected. <br /><br />
            Africa has recorded fewer than 6,000 deaths, according to an AFP
            tally, but just five countries account for 70% of these: South
            Africa, Algeria, Nigeria, Egypt and Sudan. <br /><br />
            In Africa, “the pandemic is still concentrated in and around capital
            cities but we are seeing more and more cases spread out into the
            provinces,” Moeti said. <br /><br />
            She said that in most countries on the continent, the virus entered
            capitals through international flights from Europe. <br /><br />
            Africa’s relatively young population compared to other continents,
            and in-built experience of dealing with disease outbreaks have been
            cited as reasons why Africa has not so far seen the death rates
            experienced on other continents. <br /><br />
            Moeti said early action by African countries had helped keep the
            numbers low - but constant vigilance was still needed. <br /><br />
            The US remains the worst-affected country worldwide, passing 2
            million infections on Thursday. Spikes have been recorded in several
            states, including Arizona, which is confirming more than 1,000 cases
            daily. <br /><br />
            US president Donald Trump has introduced a policy stopping attendees
            at his rallies from suing the campaign or venue if they contract
            coronavirus at the events. A statement on the campaign website page
            for a rally in Tulsa says: “By clicking register below, you are
            acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists
            in any public place where people are present. By attending the
            Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to
            exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for
            President, Inc.; BOK Center; ASM Global; or any of their affiliates
            … liable for any illness or injury.” <br /><br />
            Stocks fell sharply Thursday on Wall Street as coronavirus cases
            increased, deflating recent optimism for a quick economic recovery.
            The DOW Jones Industrial Average saw its worst day in weeks, closing
            down almost 7%. Asian shares were moderately lower on Friday as a
            result of the overnight rout. <br /><br />
            The US Federal Reserve warned on Wednesday that a second wave of
            infections risks prolonging the country’s recovery. The Fed
            predicted unemployment will still be at around 9% by December –
            close to the worst levels seen in the GFC – but Federal Reserve
            chair Jerome Powell said that a second outbreak could mean that
            figure was optimistic.
